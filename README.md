# Distributed-System

Write a program that allows you to query distributed log files on multiple machines, from any one of those machines. The scenario is that you have N (>5) machines, each generating a log file (named machine.i.log). You open a terminal on any of those N machines. You should now be able to execute a grep command that runs on all the log files across all machines, and produces
output on your terminal (with the appropriate lines to designate which log entries come from).
